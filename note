## I do not own any of the assets used here!
The scripts that are not loadstrings are stored in one here, we are not claming to be you or the owners of the script, There will be a notice on the assets version of Rlxl Library 2 about this. There are no modifications (unless script is glitchy and there are fixes for it, example: eclipse not loading on electron/valyse.)
If one of the scripts here wants to be taken down by the script owner, I am happy to do so.
